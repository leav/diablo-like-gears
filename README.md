Diablo-like gears for RPG Maker XP
==========================
This script provides ways to generate randomized gears for games created by RPG Maker XP. Originally, one type of gears share a same object, thus making property variation for gears of same type impossible. This script represents each gear with its own object, also keeping most of the original gear object interface to RPG Maker XP.
